此项目是橘子网上商城的功能，按照我自己的想法实现的一个自营模式的商城应用。 目前实现了前台的功能，后台的功能,主要有登录，注册，商品展示，购物车等模块。后台面有添加商品,删除商品,商品上下架,订单管理,管理员管理,实现了E支付功能和百度地图功能.为了便于此项目日后的完善和扩展， 我采用了前后端分离的架构设计。前端主要使用javaScript,jquery,AjAX,JSP构建的单页web应用， 通过使用指令，服务，模板，控制器完成前端的MVC分层，各个模板页面的效果实现则使用了基本的CSS3等技术， 结合JS完成页面的基本交互效果。由于有实现数据库和后台模块等功能，通过AJax请求完成整个前台功能的数据交互， 后期再考虑实现一个后台管理系统及数据库系统，还有前端页面资源的异步加载及优化。	= @ =	shoppingPro

This project born from the need from people to have a way of communication between municipalities and communities.  Some municipalities, have their platforms, but they are complex to validate the veracity of complaints.  Denounced, it was born with the purpose of offering a free platform to these municipalities.  Denounced consists of three main modules developed with Microsoft technologies, using the .Net Framework and Xamarin for its development:  1. Back End Web Project:  Module of administration of the complaints, by the employees of the town councils.  In this tool, the employees of the city council receive, validate, report and close the complaints, after being served.  2. Web Portal Client:  It consists of a web project, so that the community make their complaints, in the same, the users of the service create a profile, must specify when making their complaint, evidence to support this.  Through the portal, they can see the complaints of other community members, follow it, give their opinion or provide possible solutions or more evidence.  3. Mobile Project:  It has the same functionalities as the web portal, with the addition, that the automatic location can be sent, from the cell phone.	= @ =	Denunciado

Die COVID-19-Impfung kann einen Wendepunkt in der Kontrolle der COVID-19-Pandemie darstellen und erfährt daher hohes Maß an öffentlicher Aufmerksamkeit. Einführung und Umsetzung der COVID-19-Impfung gehen mit besonderen Herausforderungen einher, die bei der Impfdatenerfassung zu berücksichtigen sind. In diesem Kontext ist es Ziel des Projekts 'Digitales Impfquoten-Monitoring' (DIM), tagesaktuell, bundesweit die Impfquote zu erfassen und folgend aufbereitet darzustellen, um zeitnah den Verlauf der COVID-19-Impfkampanne zu analysieren, bei Bedarf nachzusteuern, und logistisch bzw. organisatorische Konsequenzen zu ziehen. <br><br>Das DIM-Projekt enthält Daten über den Verlauf der COVID-19 Impfungen in Deutschland. Die hier veröffentlichten Impfdaten aggregieren Daten aus drei Datenquellen: Neben dem Meldeweg über die DIM-Anwdung werden zur Erfassung der Impfquote auch Impfdaten niedergelassener Ärzt_innenpraxen durch die Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV) und Minimaldatensätze der Bundesländer (die noch nicht über das DIM melden) erfasst.	= @ =	COVID-19-Impfungen_in_Deutschland

这是我自己做的一个类似滴滴打车的Android出行项目，主要针对滴滴等出行平台一直饱受质疑的“人车不符”问题，以及当前越发火热的或计划和出海战略，给出行项目增加了下面几个功能：  1. RFID识别验证功能：在司机证件或者车内识别硬件嵌入RFID识别芯片，乘客使用手机读取到芯片信息，并且通过网络发送到出行平台数据库进行验证（我用JNI加了一个C语言的MD5加密算法对识别到的信息进行了加密）。如果不是合规的“人”或“车”，则不能完成订单并向平台或监管单位汇报当前位置。（为了方便读者测试，可以使用手机读取任何一个加密或非加密RFID芯片，比如银行卡、公交卡等，我在代码中的验证前阶段把芯片信息都换成我自己的司机信息，确保读者测试时可以收到服务器的回复） 2. 海外版功能：点击切换当前语言。 3. 司机证件号码识别功能：读取司机证件上的证件号码，也可以用来与出行平台数据库的接单司机信息进行。I complete this whole project on my own . Including Android application programming，web server ( Apache + PHP + MySQL),  and UI.  1．Map route planing。You can use mobile phone choose pick up & destination address，application provide address name hint and draw optimized route for user , then call car for you. 2．RFID authentication function：User can use application to scan driver license or other RFID hardware, then use NDK MD5 algorithm encrypt RFID number, and send it to Web Server Database, check with driver information and authenticate ID number , if ID number coherent with driver info , send back driver information to User and continue call car order . record user location  and alert if ID not coherent. 3．Driver License Number Recognition : Application can recognize driver license digit number ,and also can send to web server for authentication & feed back result to user.	= @ =	DiDiCallCar

🔥🔥🔥FlyClould 微服务实战项目框架，在该框架中，包括了用 Spring Cloud 构建微服务的一系列基本组件和框架，对于后台服务框架的搭建有很大的参考价值，大家可以参考甚至稍加修改可以直接应用于自己的实际的项目开发中，该项目没有采用Maven进行项目构建，Maven通过xml进行依赖管理，导致整个配置文件太过臃肿，另外灵活性也不是很强，所以我采用Gradle进行项目构建和依赖管理，在FlyTour项目中我们见证了Gradle的强大，通过简单的一些配置就可以轻松的实现组件化的功能。该项目共有11个Module工程。其中10个位微服务工程，这10个微服务工程构成了一个完整的微服务系统，微服务系统包含了8个基础服务，提供了一整套微服务治理功能，他们分别是配置中心module_config、注册中心module_eureka、认证授权中心module_uaa、Turbine聚合监控服务module_monitor、链路追踪服务module_zipken、聚合监控服务module_admin、路由网关服务module_gateway、日志服务module_log。另外还包含了两个资源服务：用户服务module_user和blog服务module_blog，另外还有一个common的Module,为资源服务提供一些一本的工具类	= @ =	spring-cloud-flycloud

TNN: developed by Tencent Youtu Lab and Guangying Lab, a uniform deep learning inference framework for mobile、desktop and server. TNN is distinguished by several outstanding features, including its cross-platform capability, high performance, model compression and code pruning. Based on ncnn and Rapidnet, TNN further strengthens the support and performance optimization for mobile devices, and also draws on the advantages of good extensibility and high performance from existed open source efforts. TNN has been deployed in multiple Apps from Tencent, such as Mobile QQ, Weishi, Pitu, etc. Contributions are welcome to work in collaborative with us and make TNN a better framework.	= @ =	TNN

Objectron is a dataset of short, object-centric video clips. In addition, the videos also contain AR session metadata including camera poses, sparse point-clouds and planes. In each video, the camera moves around and above the object and captures it from different views. Each object is annotated with a 3D bounding box. The 3D bounding box describes the object’s position, orientation, and dimensions.

This project born from the need from people to have a way of communication between municipalities and communities.  Some municipalities, have their platforms, but they are complex to validate the veracity of complaints.  Denounced, it was born with the purpose of offering a free platform to these municipalities.  Denounced consists of three main modules developed with Microsoft technologies, using the .Net Framework and Xamarin for its development:  1. Back End Web Project:  Module of administration of the complaints, by the employees of the town councils.  In this tool, the employees of the city council receive, validate, report and close the complaints, after being served.  2. Web Portal Client:  It consists of a web project, so that the community make their complaints, in the same, the users of the service create a profile, must specify when making their complaint, evidence to support this.  Through the portal, they can see the complaints of other community members, follow it, give their opinion or provide possible solutions or more evidence.  3. Mobile Project:  It has the same functionalities as the web portal, with the addition, that the automatic location can be sent, from the cell phone.	= @ =	Denunciado
